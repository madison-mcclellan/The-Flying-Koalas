# Checkpoint 3: Interactive Data Visualization

In this checkpoint we used an interactive bar graph to observe how the distribution of TRRs by action type (e.g. verbal commands, taser, etc.) changes in relation to police district, subject age, subject race, lighting condition, whether the officer was on or off duty, and the year. Furthermore, we wanted to observe whether this distribution is dependent on the group of officers being observed. Do officers in the highest percentile of TRRs use specific types of force more than officers in a lower percentile of TRRs?

We created the visualization in an Observable Notebook. The link to the notebook can be found in the src directory. When opening the notebook, you will see that it gives an error message because databases are not accessible in public notebooks. For the database connection to work, you must fork the notebook to create your own private version. You can do this by pressing the three dots in the top right corner then "Fork."
