# Checkpoint 3: Interactive Data Visualization

In this checkpoint we sought to understand how the distribution of TRRs across action types changes in relation to the following five factors: police district, subject age, subject race, lighting condition, and whether the officer was on duty. To do this, we created a bar chart that partitions the TRRs based on action type. The user can filter the data by choosing values for all of the aforementioned attributes.

We created the visualization in an Observable Notebook. The link to the notebook can be found in the src directory. When opening the notebook, you will see that it gives an error message because databases are not accessible in public notebooks. For the database connection to work, you must fork the notebook to create your own private version. You can do this by pressing the three dots in the top right corner then "Fork."
