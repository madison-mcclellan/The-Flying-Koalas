# Checkpoint 4: Graph Analytics

## Running the Code
The code for this checkpoint was written in a Databricks notebook. The exported notebook can be found in the src directory. The easiest way to run the code is to open it in a new Databricks notebook so the dependencies are handled. From there, the code can be run and the outputs are printed to the console. 

## Questions

#### If we construct a graph where nodes represent officers and edges signify that two officers were involved in the same allegation, can we then determine whether specific officers are more involved than others in these incidents?
To answer this question we used the PageRank algorithm. This section of the code is labeled accordingly. 

#### Can we determine whether the graph described above contains many clusters (i.e. officers are highly connected in allegations) or whether officers are more isolated? How does this compare to a graph of officers involved in TRRs?
To answer this question we used the Triangle Count algorithm. This section of the code is labeled accordingly.
